# The Mindfulness of Man

Modern man has formed a curiously distored picture of himself, by interpreting his early history in terms of his present interests in making machines and conquering nature. And then in turn he has justified his present concerns by calling his prehistoric self a tool-making animal, and assuming that the material instruments of production dominated all his other activities.

There is sound reason to believe that man's brain was from the beginning far more important than his hands, and its size could not be derived solely from his shaping or using of tools; that ritual and language and social organization which left no material traces whatever, although constantly present in every culture, were probably man's most important artifacts from the earliest stages on; and that so far from conquering nature or reshaping his environment primitive man's first concern was to utilize his overdeveloped, intensely active nervous system, and to give form to a human self, set apart from his original animal self by the fabrication of symbols---the only tools that could be constructed out of the resources provided by his own body: dreams, images and sounds.

The very existence of gramatically complex and highly articulated langauges at the onset of civilization five thousand years ago, when tools were still extremely primitive, suggests that the human race may have had even more fundamental needs than getting a living, since it might have continued to do the latter on the same terms as its hominid ancestors. If this is so, what were these needs?

From the moment _Homo sapiens_, at least, makes his appearance, we find evidences in his attitude toward death, toward ancestral spirits, toward future existence, toward sun and sky, that betray a consciousness that forces and beings, distant in space and time, unapproachable if not invisible, may nevertheless play a controlling part in man's life. This was a true intuition, although it may have taken hundreds and thousands of years before its full import and rational proof could be grasped by the human mind, which now ranges between invisible particles and equally mysterious retreating galaxies.

There seems a likelihood that the earliest peoples, perhaps even before language was available, had a dim consciousness of the mystery of their own being: a greater incentive to reflection and self-development than any pragmatic effort to adjust to a narrower environment. Take the mysterious imprints of human hands made upon the walls of caves as far apart as Africa and Australia. These imprints are all the more puzzling because so many of these hands show one or more finger joints missing. Given that there are still tribes equally widely separated where the sacrifice of a finger joint is a rite of mourning: a personal loss to emphasize a greater loss, one can speculate that these imprints were a secondary symbol of grief, tranferred for perpetuation from the short-lived primary symbol of flesh and bone to a stone surface. In these cases, the rite itself reveals an eminent human susceptibility to strong feeling about matters of ultimate concern, along with a desire to retain and transmit that feeling. This must have cemented family life and group loyalty, and thus have contributed quite as effectively to survival as any improvement in flaking flint tools. Although in many other species the parent will on occasion sacrifice its life to protect its mate or its young, this voluntary _symbolic_ sacrifice of a finger joint is a distinctly human trait. Where such feeling is lacking, as so often in the whole routine of our mechanized, impersonal megalopolitan culture, the human ties become so weak that only stringent external regimentation will hold the group together.
