# Prologue

The last century, we all realize, has witnessed a radical transformation in the entire human environment, largely as a result of the impact of the mathematical and physical sciences upon technology. This shift has opened up such new realms as those of nuclear energy, supersonic transportation, cybernetic intelligence and instantaneous distant communication. Never since the Pyramid Age have such vast physical changes been consummated in so short a time. All these changes have, in turn, produced alterations to the human personality, while still more radical transformations, if this process continue unabated and uncorrected, loom ahead.

With this new 'megatechincs' the dominant minority will create a uniform, all-enveloping, super-planatery structure, designe d for automatic opeartion. Instead of functioning actiely as an autonomous personality, man will become a passive, purposeless, machine-conditioned animal whose proper functions, as technicians now interpret man's role, will either be fed into the machine or strictly limited and controlled for the benefit of de-personalized, collective organizations.

My purpose in this book is to question both the assumptions and the predictions upon which our commitment to the present forms of technical and scientific progress, treated as if ends in themselves, has been based...

Just because man's need for tools is so obvious, we must guard ourselves against over-stressing the role of stone tools hundreds of thousands of years before they become functionally differentiated and efficient. In treating tool-making as central to early man's survival, biologists and anthropologists for long underplayed, or neglected, a mass of activities in which many other species were for long more knowledgeable htan man. Despite evidence to the contrary, there is still a tendency to identify tools and machines with technology: to substitute the part for the whole.

If technical proficiency alone were sufficient to identify and foster intelligence, then man was for long a laggard if we take into consideration the radical innovations of other animals, with their intricate nests and bowers, their geometric beehives, their urbanoid anthills and termitaries, their beaver lodges. There was nothing uniquely human in tool-making until it was modified by linguistic symobls, esthetic designs, and socially transmitted knowledge...What is specially and uniquely human is man's capacity to combine a wide variety of animal propensities into an emergent cultural entity: a human personality.

Through man's overdeveloped and incessantly active brain, he had more mental energy to tap than he needed for survival at a purely animal level; and he was accordingly under the necessity of canalizing that energy, not just into food-getting and sexual reproduction, but into modes of living that would convert this energy more directly and constructively into appropriate cultural -- that is, symbolic -- forms. Only by creating cultural outles could he tap and control and fully utilize his own nature.

There is even reason to ask whether the standardized patterns observable in early tool-making are not in part derivable from the strictly repetitive motions of ritual, song, and dance, forms that have long existed in a state of perfection among primitive peoples, usually in far more finished style than their tools.

Only a little while ago the Dutch historian, J. Huzinga, in 'Homo Ludens' brought forth a mass of evidence to suggest that play, rather than work, was the formative element in human culture: that man's most serious activity belonged to the realm of make-believe. On this showing, ritual and mimesis, sports and games and dramas, released man from his insistent animal attachments. So certain were nineteenth-century archeologists about the primacy of stone tools and weapons in the 'struggle for existence' that when the first paleolithic cave paintings were discovered in Spain in 1879, they were denounced, out of hand, as an outrageous hoax, by 'competent authorities' on the ground that Ice Age hunters could not have had the leisure or the mind to produce the elegant art of Altamira. But mind was exactly what _Homo Sapiens_ possessed, and I submit that at every stage man's inventions and transformations were less for the purpose of increasing the food supply or controlling nature than for utilizing his own immense organic resources and expressing his latent potentialities, in order to fulfill more adequately his superorganic demands and aspirations.

When not curbed by hostile environmental pressures, man's elaboration of symbolic culture answered a more imperative need than that for control over the environment. Besides the relatively simple coordination required for tool-using, the delicate interplay of the many organs needed for the creation of articulate speech was a far more striking advance. This effort must have occupied a greater part of early man's time, energy and mental activity, since the ultimate collective product, spoken language, was infinitely more complex and sophisticated at the dawn of civilization that the Egyptian or Mesopotamian kit of tools. To consider man, then, as primarily a tool-using animal is to overlook the main chapters of human history. Opposed to this notion, I shall develop the view that man is pre-eminently a mind-making, self-mastering, and self-designing animal; and the primary locus of all his activity lies first in his own organism, and in the social organization through which it finds fuller expression.

In this process of self-discovery and self-transformation, tools, in the narrow sense, served well as subsidiary instruments, but not as the main operative agent in man's development; for technics has never till our own age dissociated itself from the larger cultural whole in which man has always functioned. The classic Greek term _tekhne_ characteristically makes no distiction between industrial production and 'fine' or symbolic art; ;and for the greater part of human history these aspects were inseparable, one side respecting the objective conditions and funcitons, the other responding to subjective needs.

The specific human achievement, which set man apart from even his nearest anthropoid relatives, was the shaping of a new self, visibily different in appearance, in behavior, and in plan of life from his primitive animal forebears. As this differentiation widened, man speeded up the process of his own evolution, achieving through culture in a relatively short span of years changes that other species accomplised laboriously through organic processes.

Henceforth, the main business of man was his own self-transformation. This self-transformation not merely rescued man from permanent fixation in his original animal condition, but freed his best-developed organ, his brain, for other tasks than those of ensuring physical survival. The dominant human trait, central to all other traits, is this capacity for conscious, purposeful self-identification, self-transformation, and ultimately for self-understanding.
