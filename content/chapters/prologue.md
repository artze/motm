# Prologue

The last century, we all realize, has witnessed a radical transformation in the entire human environment, largely as a result of the impact of the mathematical and physical sciences upon technology. This shift has opened up such new realms as those of nuclear energy, supersonic transportation, cybernetic intelligence and instantaneous distant communication. Never since the Pyramid Age have such vast physical changes been consummated in so short a time. All these changes have, in turn, produced alterations to the human personality, while still more radical transformations, if this process continue unabated and uncorrected, loom ahead.

With this new 'megatechincs' the dominant minority will create a uniform, all-enveloping, super-planatery structure, designe d for automatic opeartion. Instead of functioning actiely as an autonomous personality, man will become a passive, purposeless, machine-conditioned animal whose proper functions, as technicians now interpret man's role, will either be fed into the machine or strictly limited and controlled for the benefit of de-personalized, collective organizations.

My purpose in this book is to question both the assumptions and the predictions upon which our commitment to the present forms of technical and scientific progress, treated as if ends in themselves, has been based...

Just because man's need for tools is so obvious, we must guard ourselves against over-stressing the role of stone tools hundreds of thousands of years before they become functionally differentiated and efficient. In treating tool-making as central to early man's survival, biologists and anthropologists for long underplayed, or neglected, a mass of activities in which many other species were for long more knowledgeable htan man. Despite evidence to the contrary, there is still a tendency to identify tools and machines with technology: to substitute the part for the whole.

If technical proficiency alone were sufficient to identify and foster intelligence, then man was for long a laggard if we take into consideration the radical innovations of other animals, with their intricate nests and bowers, their geometric beehives, their urbanoid anthills and termitaries, their beaver lodges. There was nothing uniquely human in tool-making until it was modified by linguistic symobls, esthetic designs, and socially transmitted knowledge...What is specially and uniquely human is man's capacity to combine a wide variety of animal propensities into an emergent cultural entity: a human personality.
